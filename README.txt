Welcome Dude!

This is the WG-Project,
this folder structure contains the whole content, which is required
to start this application, expect a php and mysql server to execute this code.

Easy way to run this is-> install xampp -> throw this project into his htdocs -> start xampp apache and mysql -> enjoy :)
sample url:http://localhost/wg_project/frontend/site/

Structure:

-backend
contains basic classes and functions in php (javascript and html are in php)

-data
contains all datasources, like css, images, xml ...

-documentation
contains the whole project documentation splitted in git, general and software documentation,
last one describe just the software and can be used to easily understand and enter this project

data are just a vessel for non-script dokumentation, like images or saves of other programs,
so it's a source for the other documentation folders.

-frontend
contains all display functions, which simply use the backend to build the sites

-sql_schema
contains all database changes as sql query to make easy copies and restores of it
