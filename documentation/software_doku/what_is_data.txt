Data is a folder with most different subfolders.

You can found:

-css->main.css (all costume css parts are located in this file, all other comes from libraries)
-framework (current empty)
-image (contains all images used in the application)
-js->main.js (current empty, the js part is still located in backend)
-library (Much libraries are included for Bootstrap, Jquery, Jquery_Ui and Jscrollpane)
-sound (if we need sound it would be located here)
-xml (current empty, should contain all needed xml files)

If you want to add something,
please check if it fit in this folder!

The common reason to enter data is to add css code.
