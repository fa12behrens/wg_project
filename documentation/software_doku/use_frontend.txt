hierarchy [site <- component <- part <- job <- base <- source]
		  |		  Frontend		   |
Attention you must need this hierarchy, as example site can use source and job can use base,
but part can't use component, I think it's self-explanatory.
Best way is to call the next smaller unit (example: site call component), source is a exception.

As you can see, our frontend has 3 folders too.

- part

Parts are the smallest unit for frontend,
they are used to fill up the components.
Parts are build up with jobs and of course source.
As example it can be a toolbar which is called by the component toolbox.

- component

The components are the basicly the biggest part.
They called a whole part of the side,
which can do jobs and display source, or just implement
a number of parts.
As example toolbox is called by the sidebuilder tool.

- site

Contains 2 files, one of them is the index,
the index is usually called by loading the application.
He simply calls the sitebuilder, which build the complete
backbone for the site and calls the components.
